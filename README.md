# Number Guessing Game
This code repository contains a simple number guessing game that I developed as part of a challenge on Udemy. 
The purpose of this game is to allow the user to guess a randomly generated number by the computer.


Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and use it for educational or personal purposes.
If you have any suggestions or improvements for the code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Future Improvements
In the future, I intend to add error handling to validate user input and ensure that it is within the intended range. 
This will help prevent the program from crashing or producing unexpected behavior if the user enters an invalid input.
